2019-10-05 06:44How to fix the day and time globally? Our 12H clock is useful but not the present AM-PM toggle. Instead we can toggle a bit 0 fixed at 6:00 am and 6:00pm and connect it across the globe.
This dynamic toggle over any location on the Earth can make the day-time specification a true day-time in the electronic world.06:52
A6D== B6N or A6N== B6D Can we fix the event calendar more harmoniously across the other side of the globe in the internet? A bit toggle logic like After 6AM Day time OR Before 6PM; and Before 6AM Night time OR After 6PM across any point on the globe.
